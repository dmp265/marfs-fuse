intention is for the caller to have euid == root at this point ( or some other
marfs-specific user, we can discuss this ).  This function will access secure files/dirs.
This is a one time event.  After completion of initialization, the caller can safely setuid()
to a user, dropping ALL elevated permissions.*/

idea is that any initialized context will use its own internal marfs_dhandle to reference a

cwd.
By default, this internal cwd will be the root of the MarFS mountpoint.  However, this
function allows you to change that.
When executed, marfs will replace the internal cwd marfs_dhandle of the context structure
with the 'newdir' dhandle.  The original, internal marfs_dhandle will then be returned to
the caller.

fhandle from a previous set of files will allow those files to be packed together.
Otherwise, if the 'stream' arg is NULL, this will begin a new data stream.
Note -- I've chosen to mirror the posix creat() implementation to distinguish between
creation of a new file, and update of an existing file.  Any file creation must be a
complete overwrite of any existing file, with the entire data set written from beginning to
end.  The exception would be for chunked files, which can be written at specific offsets by
parallel processes ( see below ).*/

A MARFS_WRITE handle is intended for use by parallel writers, writing various 'chunks' of a
large file, or for use in data modifications such as marfs_ftruncate().
Note -- for security reasons, it will be impossible for file handles created by this
function to finalize this file ( via close() or creat() ) unless the 'original' handle has

for a description, excluding the SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE values).  For MARFS_READ handles,
this can be any offset value.  For MARFS_WRITE handles, the provided offset *must* align
with underlying chunk boundaries (this is intended to support parallel write).*/

/* Similar to ftruncate, this will adjust the referenced file to the given size.  However,
there is a crucial difference between the two.  marfs_ftruncate() will only allow the caller
to operate on finalized files, for which the total data size has been locked in (via
marfs_close(), marfs_creat(), or marfs_release()), and will only allow the true data size of
the file to shrink (truncating smaller reduces actual data size, truncating larger only
adds 'fake' zero-fill data).
This function is the opposite case, as it can only be used against files whose data has not
yet been finalized.  In such a case, the referenced file will have its real data bounds
extended to include the specified amount of data.  To put it another way, this function will
instruct marfs to assume that 'length' bytes of actual data objects will be written to this
file.  This enables parallel writers to use marfs_open() handles to write these non-existent
data chunks in arbitrary order.
Note -- this function is only usable via an 'original' file handle, meaning a handle created
specifically via a marfs_creat() operation.  This is intended to limit race-conditions
associated with multiple processes extending file bounds as other processes attempt to close
the file and continue with the same data stream.*/

/* Possibly sync data objects and flush cached data.  If called more than once on the same
file handle, is a no-op.*/

/* Close the given file handle and finalize the data stream.
Note -- many ops, such as marfs_ftruncate, extend, utimens, and even write, may not be
committed to the FS until 'finalization' of the data stream.  This means that it is
*essential* to check the return code of this function.  A failure of this call may indicate
incomplete operations throughout the *entire* data stream referenced by this handle.*/
int marfs_close(marfs_fhandle stream);

/* Close the given file handle, but allow the data stream to be updated in the future (such
as by parallel writers).*/

	Initialization:	marfs_creat(...) -> ohandle
